DLMDWPMP01 Coding with Python - **functionfinder**
==================================================

The **main effort** of this package is to gain basic python programming skills
and therefore solve a simple classification task. This package is designed to
fulfill the given task and complete the IU Python Module 'DLMDWPMP01'.


The **task** was to:

Evaluate ideal functions for a set of training data (1) and assign
values of a test-dataset to those ideal functions (2)

Used criteria for evaluation:

(1) to match training data and ideal functions:
minimum SummedSquaredError (SSE)

(2) to match ideal functions and test data:
precalculated SSE (1) * SquareRoot(2)

After **installing** the package by typing 'pip install -e .' in your console, the
program 'functionfinder' can be called from the console, using the CLI-command **'ff'**.
